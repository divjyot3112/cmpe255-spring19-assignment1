There were some records which were observed that the classifier and the star rating by yelp differed as black and white!

On observing closely on the data, there were 3 reasons to be found:
1. The ratings for some of the bad and neutral reviews were higher, this benefits the restaurants a lot and degrades the data on the other hand.
2. The other reason is simply the inaccurate prediction from the classifier itself which were both ways, highly rated bad reviews and low rated good reviews.
3. The third reason being unpredicitble nature of humans, this is the only reason it is so hard for machines to predict on human behaviour. Every person has a different perpective, different people can rate the same review differently.
